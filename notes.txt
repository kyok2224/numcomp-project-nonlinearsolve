Possible topics to explore:

measure execution time between difference solver algorithms on the same or multiple problems
algorithms: NewtonRaphson, TrustRegion, Broyden, Klement
explore why some algorithms will be faster than others

visiualize and comprare the convergence speed to the runtime of each algorithm

explore tolerance within an algorithm
change the tolerance (absolute, relative, or both) and see how the runtime changes with precision
Show the tradeoff between speed and accuracy

explore how the difference algorithms perform when the initial guess is far from the true solution
for example newtons method can diverge if the inital guess is bad. Look into bracketing methods

show how the difference algorithms perform when working with large systems of equations
